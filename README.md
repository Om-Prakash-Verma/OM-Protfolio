# Om Prakash Verma | Premium Personal Portfolio

> **"AI is a productivity multiplier, not a replacement for thinking."**

A premium, cinematic personal portfolio website designed for a Computer Science Engineering student specializing in **System Architecture** and **AI-Assisted Web Development**. 

This project moves away from generic "tutorial-style" portfolios, focusing instead on **depth, reasoning, and system design**. The visual identity is built around a **Black & Gold** aesthetic—conveying confidence, luxury, and solidity without unnecessary flashiness.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### The "System-First" Persona
The portfolio is crafted to position the engineer not just as a coder, but as an architect. 
- **Typography:** Uses `Outfit` (clean, modern sans-serif) for body text and `Space Grotesk` (technical, slightly brutalist) for headers to balance readability with a "tech-forward" feel.
- **Color Palette:**
  - **Void Black (`#050505`)**: The foundation. Represents depth and focus.
  - **Metallic Gold (`#D4AF37` / `#F59E0B`)**: Used strictly for highlights, calls-to-action, and semantic emphasis. It signifies value and premium quality.
  - **Neutral Greys**: Used for secondary text to maintain high contrast and accessibility.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Built with a focus on clean architecture and performance, even within a client-side environment.

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
